# Infinite World

Infinite World is an immersive, procedurally generated 3D environment created using WebGL with Three.js. This project aims to provide a limitless, expansive world that continuously evolves as users explore it. It's designed primarily for exploration and experimentation, showcasing the power of procedural generation techniques in a 3D space. Whether you're a developer interested in how such worlds are built, or simply someone who loves endless virtual environments, Infinite World offers a beautiful sandbox to get lost in.

## Features

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: The landscape is dynamically generated, ensuring that no two regions are the same, giving a unique experience each time you explore.
- **Infinite Exploration**: The world extends infinitely, making every journey distinct and providing endless opportunities for discovery.
- **WebGL and Three.js**: Built using WebGL and Three.js, Infinite World demonstrates how complex 3D environments can run efficiently in the browser.
- **No Purpose, Just Fun**: The project is purely for fun and educational purposes, with no set objectives or game mechanicsâ€”just a space to explore, learn, and enjoy.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run Infinite World locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system.
